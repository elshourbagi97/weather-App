A simple and dynamic weather application that allows users to search for weather conditions in any city worldwide or fetch data based on their current location.

It leverages the browser’s Geolocation API and integrates with a third-party weather API (like OpenWeatherMap) to fetch accurate weather information. The UI includes subtle animations and a responsive layout for enhanced user experience on all devices.
